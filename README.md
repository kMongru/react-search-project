## React Search Visualization

### Project Description

This project is a demostration of BFS and DFS on a classic LeetCode island searching problem. I worked with React.js and JavaScript to build out the project which is live and hosted **[HERE](https://kMongru.github.io/react-search-project)**! 

The project taught me about how to handle re-rendering the state of components when triggered in another class and dealing with stack and queue data structures in JavaScript.
